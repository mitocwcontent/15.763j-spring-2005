description: The thesis proposes a method for introducing cellular manufacturing in
  an operating job shop. By applying cellular manufacturing to produce part families
  with similar manufacturing processes and stable demand, plants expect to reduce
  costs and lead-times and improve quality and delivery performance. The thesis outlines
  a method for assessing, designing, and implementing cellular manufacturing, and
  illustrates this process with an example. A manufacturing cell that produces aluminum
  parts for commercial customers is implemented at Boeing?s Defense and Space Group
  Machining Center.  The conclusions of the thesis highlight the key lessons learned
  from thisprocess.

Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1.5 hours / session

Course Outline and Assignments
------------------------------

This class will be a mix of lectures, case discussions and applications. The course objectives are to develop modeling skills and to provide new concepts and problem-solving tools, applicable to the design of manufacturing systems and supply chains.

Note: [15.762J](/courses/15-762j-supply-chain-planning-spring-2011) offered in H1 is **not** a prerequisite for 15.763J in H2. Nevertheless, 15.762J should be very helpful for this class.

Course requirements are to come to class prepared and ready to participate in the class. There will be a number of group assignments throughout the class. The grading will depend on the assignments and contribution to the class. We recommend the following book, and will suggest complementary readings throughout the class:

Simchi-Levi, David, Philip Kaminsky, and Edith Simchi-Levi. _Designing and Managing the Supply Chain_. 2nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw Hill, 2003. ISBN: 0071410317. (SKS)

We also recommend and suggest the following books as useful references or complements:

Hopp, Wallace and Mark Spearman. _Factory Physics_. 2nd ed. Boston, MA: Irwin, 2000. ISBN: 0256247951. (HS)

Nahmias, Steven. _Production and Operations Analysis_. 4th ed. Boston, MA: Irwin, 2000. ISBN: 0072417412. (N)

Chopra, Sunil and Peter Meindl. _Supply Chain Management_. 2nd ed. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2004. ISBN: 013101028X. (CM)

Shapiro, Jeremy. _Modeling the Supply Chain_. Pacific Grove, CA: Duxbury, 2001. ISBN: 0534373631. (S)

Silver, Edward, David Pyke, and Rein Peterson. _Inventory Management and Production Planning and Scheduling_. 3rd ed. New York, NY: Wiley, 1998. ISBN: 0471119474. (SPP)

As a supplement to the class we have invited a few guest speakers for a public seminar series on supply chain planning. We expect to hold these seminars about once every two or three weeks.

Course Requirements
-------------------

The written assignments are to be done by groups. Each group must have at least three and no more than four students. Each group needs to stay together for the term.

| Written assignments | Due dates | PointS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manzana Insurance | Session 3 | 15 |
| Transportation National Group | Session 8 | 15 |
| Metal Work | Session 10 | 30 |
| Seagate | Session 13 | 15 

**Each group must submit the Metal Works case and two other written assignments of its choosing: each assignment should be no more than 4 typed pages, no smaller than this font (Times, 12 point); 2-3 pages should be sufficient for most assignments**_._

In addition there are four small assignments.

| assignments | Due dates | Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Queuing Modeling | Session 5 | 10 |
| Logistic System Design | Session 11 | 10 |
| Procurement Game | Session 14 | 10 |
| Capacity Planning and Flexibility | Session 15 | 10 

Students are encouraged to participate in class. Individual students can earn up to three points from their participation. We will judge class participation based on the quality of answers given to posed questions, contributions to a discussion of case material, and questions raised by the student.

Academic Honesty
----------------

The rules of the MIT Faculty state: "The attempt of any student to present as his or her own the work of another, or any work which he or she has not honestly performed, or to pass any examination by improper means, is regarded by the Faculty as a most serious offense, and renders the offender liable to immediate expulsion. The aiding and abetting of a student in any dishonesty is likewise held to be a great breach of discipline."

In the context of this class, we expect you to work in groups, but groups should work independently and should not consult with each other about a particular assignment. Also, several of the cases have been used in prior years. We regard as inappropriate any substantive consultation with students from prior years about a particular assignment. We also regard as inappropriate any use of notes or videos from prior years.

If you are uncertain about any aspect or instance of this policy, please ask one of the instructors for clarification.
